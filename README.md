<h1>Background</h1>
<p><strong>[AgriHub]</strong> is a retailer premium channel based in Africa. As an organization, we have identified the needs for creating  an ecommerce application related to  provide  farmers  an  opportunity for the  sales of their  agricultural  products  and services with no barrier  of time and location. It enhances agricultural  production,  products marketing  and  creates  business  opportunities for retailers,  logistic companies,  and  other relevant sectors . The website is expected to be visually appealing, easy to navigate and manage.
